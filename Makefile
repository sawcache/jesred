# HINT: If you want to run the program on an UltraSPARC driven machine,
#       I recommend to use Sun C-Compiler >= 4.0 or gcc >= 2.8.0 with
#       optimization level >= 4 for best performance.

# If you don't have regex support on your OS standard librar{y|ies}
# or you do not want to use it, get gnu regex 0.12 or higher,
# compile it as described in its INSTALL (you do not need to install it!),
# uncomment the lines below (XOBJS, DEFS) and substitute regex-0.12 with the
# directory, where GNU regex.h and regex.o are located.
# Hint: At least on Solaris >= 2.5 you get best performance, when you
# use the regex stuff from stdlibc. If you really need the GNU stuff,
# compile it with highest optimization (default is no optimization!),
# which gives you about 20% speed up ... GNU regex is available via:
# ftp://ftp.tu-chemnitz.de/pub/gnu/regex-0.12.tar.gz    (GNU mirror) or
# ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/regex-0.12.tar.gz

# XOBJS	= regex-0.12/regex.o
# DEFS	= -DLOCAL_REGEX -Iregex-0.12

# If you want to use ACCEL patterns (compatibility to squirm 1.0Beta),
# add -DUSE_ACCEL to DEFS.
#
# Since in my tests it didn't gave me much performance improvement, I don't
# use them but prefer a more readable redirect.rules files (and so a little
# bit smaller jesred wrt. memory usage). So why to compile it in, when
# I don't want to use ACCEL ;-)
# If jesred is compiled without -DUSE_ACCEL the ACCEL strings in the
# redirect rules are ignored, if there are some.
# 
# DEFS = -DUSE_ACCEL

# That's it - no further changes should be necessary ;-)
